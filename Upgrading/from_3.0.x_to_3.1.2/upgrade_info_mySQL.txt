Upgrade procedure for 3.0.W to 3.2 SQL database.

Before you start this you must have:

db password
username
db name
table prefix => ib_ or something like that


If you don't have those you must get them or you will be in trouble. If you look inside you existing forum directory in the /Data/Boardinfo.pm you will find it at the lines markes:

        'DB_DIR'               => q!#######!,
        'DB_DRIVER'        => q!mySQL!,
        'DB_IP'                 => q!localhost!,
        'DB_NAME'          => q!########
        'DB_PASS'           => q!!,
        'DB_PORT'           => q!!,
        'DB_PREFIX'        => q!ib_!,
        'DB_USER'          => q!#######!,

You must take good note of that info because this new version will encrypt the password for more security.

The first thing to do whae you found that info is to close down your existing forum. I recommend that you simply remove you existing ikonboard.cgi. This will prevent any access to the database when you are updating the database tables. If you have added any new feilds to the database tables they MUST BE REMOVED BEFORE you start the upgrade process. To do this you can use the SQL client or an interface like phpmyadmin. 

Upload the alter_table.cgi script to the base directory of your old board. (that's where ikonboard.cgi was) CHMOD it to 0755 then run it with your browser. You should have an output that will look like this:

All done, you may now remove this script

#-------------------------------

Note that it may take a few minutes to run through this script if you are on a large database. We are creating indexes and that takes time to do. When the script is all done, you will get that output. It tells you what as been done to the tables. as you can see, it is quite a large change from the old shema.


When you have finished with the script, you MUST remove it for SECURITY reasons. 

You then follow the regular procedure for a clean install. (follow the procedure in the included install guide) When you have reached the step where you enter the database info, you enter the the info that you have found in an earlier step and enter it there. Where it is asking you if you want IB to create the tables for you, you say NO, YOU MUST SAY NO THERE. When you have entered that info and you have triplecheched everything you click ONCE on the next arrow to continue. Before you click any further look inside the /Data folder using an ftp client and try to find a file called Boardinfo.cgi, if it's not there click again on the arrow to go to the next step. Look again inside the Data/ dir an try to find the Boardinfo.cgi file, it should now be there if it all worked well. You must stop just before IB populates the tables with the base info. 

When you see the file your upgrade is completed. Remove the files installer.cgi and ikonboard.conf and all the .tar files for security reasons again and you should then be able to login to you new IB3.1

Have fun with it.
